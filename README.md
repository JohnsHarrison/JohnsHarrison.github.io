A rough idea of a 2D shooter. In the future I would like to make the enemies spawn from the left and right instead of the top. I would also try having animated sprites. Unsolved issues that need fixed are the enemy speed not increasing every round and the enemies not being hittable when transition CSS is applied to them.
